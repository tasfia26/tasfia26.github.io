            <h3>What is the Web Page About, What are There, and How does it Works</h3>
            
            <div class="code-container">
                <p><li> This Web Page is used to show some reaches that is generating Hydropower to generate Electricity for Duke Energy Progress Station in South Carolina.</li></p>
				<p><li>There is an interactive Leaflet Map, where you can see the area contributing to the station, the reaches, and also the location of station.</li></p>
				<p><li>The Web Page is fetching Streamflow Forecast from the National Water Model API and representing it in chart and table</li></p>
				<p><li>You can have the forecast in three ranges - Short, Medium, and Long Range.</li></p>
				<p><li>In the chart, you can see a Threshold line, which means the streamflow when exceeds the threshold line that flow can be used to generate electricity. If it doesn't, then that flow can not be used for electricity generation.</li></p>
				<p><li>You can also look into the benefits of using the streamflow for electricity generation for Duke Energy Progress Station at the beginning of the Web Page and have an overview.</li></p>
				<p><li>Also, I have added my personal information at the left of the Web Page.</li><p>

            <h3>How to Use the Web Page</h3>
            
            <div class="code-container">
                <p><li>In the web page, you can see the Leaflet Map. There is a Polygon which is the boundary for the Duke Progress Station marked in Grey. The blue line shows the reaches contributing to the electricity generation, and the red point is the location of Duke Energy Progress Station.</li></p>
				<p><li>Under the Map, you can see a Toggle Layer where there is the Reach Layer, and the Duke Energy Progress Station Layer. You can check or uncheck the layers to be shown on the map.</li></p>
				<p><li>If the Reach Layer is unchecked, you can see the individual reach on map, when you click on the Reach ID's that are present under the Toggle Layer.</li></p>
				<p><li>If you "Click" a Reach ID, you can see a Table and a Chart having the Streamflow Forecast and the Threshold, and you can see the Reach on the Map.</li></p>
				<p><li>There is a Drop Down Box from where you can Select the Range of the Forecast.</li></p>

            <h3>How did I build the Web Page</h3>
            
            <div class="code-container">
                <p><li>From CE - 514 course, I came to learn about the HTML, Javascript, and CSS Styling. Hence, I tried to use all these to build the web page.</li></p>
				<p><li>First, I did some CSS Styling for the Web Page. I added some Toggle Layers, Drop Down Box, and Buttons for the Web Page.</li></p>
				<p><li>I tried to build an interactive Map using Leaflet Map which was taught in the class.</li></p>
				<p><li>I used Google Map, ArcGIS Pro, National Water Model API, and StreamStats to get the location of the Station, Reaches, and the Watershed Boundary respectively.</li></p>
				<p><li>Lastly, I incorporated the National Water Model API Code, that fetches the Streamflow for different Ranges.</li></p>
				<p><li>If you want to know more about the code, you can check my <a href="codeforpriojectv7.html" target="_blank">Code.</a></li></p>
